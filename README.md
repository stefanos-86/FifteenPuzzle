There is not much to say here, you should know the game.
Click on a square to move it into the hole, until all the numbers are sorted.

* I don't have prior experience with Cocos, but... it works well and it is not hard to use!
* Except its setup. It still wants Python 2 (in 2021!).
* This repository may be bigger than needed. I did not have time to find a way to avoid pushing in the whole Cocos code.
* I don't guarantee it compiles (Visual Studio 2019) out of the box.
* All I can say in my defense is that I tried to keep the code clean and defensive.
